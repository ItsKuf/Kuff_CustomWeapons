#Kuff_custom_weapons
## A UEFN Verse script that allows you to use custom weapons (kind of).

This Verse code detects, using a conditional button, if you have a certain weapon equipped. In that conditional button, we reference it in the UEFN editor. It then applies the specific VFX to the corresponding conditional button tag that we referenced in the Verse code once built. The clear VFX is used so that if we do not have any of the weapons listed on the conditional buttons, then nothing is applied.

Make sure the clear VFX has nothing in the VFX.
